1)That one friend whose pet-peeve will linger in your ear till years later, or maybe for a lifetime. That one friend who says the same thing over and over and you still find it amusing. That one friend without whose patent dialogue you cannot make it through the day. That one friend whose absence is slightly more annoying than presence. For the first time, we bring to you life at Bennett Unscripted and unfiltered.



2)A warm welcome to the new batch of 2022 on campus. Bennett University once again feels young today as we open our gates to another promising batch. It feels great to have you all with us today. We wish you all the very best as you embark upon a new journey of your life. Keep shining bright.
